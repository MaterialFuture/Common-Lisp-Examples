# Common Lisp Practice

This is just a simple repository where I'll create version control for what I'm
learning in Common Lisp.

I'm using the book Practical Common Lisp at the time of creating this
repository.

Any org files will be put into an `org` directory, to make notes on what I've
learning so others can reference and learn as well.

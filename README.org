#+TITLE: Common Lisp Practice
#+AUTHOR: MaterialFuture
Some cleanup to this repository, as I want to organize what I'm learning and showcase good practices.
I enjoy using lisp so having a place that I can work within is nice and have as a place to log my progress learning lisp, that's what this repo is meant to serve as.
* Directories
The directory structure will be simple as it'll follow what I'm working on.
Within each directory there will be all the `.lisp` files and a README in each on giving more context as to what is within (in case you or myself forget?).
- ~./basic/~ - All the work from the 'Practical Common Lisp Programming' book
- ~./challenges/~ - From the '/g/ Programming Challenges
  - [[https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/File:V1p4e.jpg][1.4e]] - Follows v1.4Îµ
  - [[https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/File:V2.png][2.0]] - Follows v2.0
- ~./landoflisp/~ - Examples and works from the 'Land of Lisp' book
- ~./org/~ - Any org notes taken to expand on what I've learned
This will change as I continue to learn more in regards to lisp, this structure at least allows me to know what I'm working on easier and keep it clean all within one project directory/repository.
* Implementation
This project uses SBCL for running these programs, and the intent is for compatibility with SLIME in Emacs, a lot of older books being written for SBCL, and also how portable the code is on other systems that aren't Linux--based
* Why Common Lisp?
I chose Common Lisp because I found more books on the subject when going to my local books stores. I've also asked around in some lisp IRCs and it seems like most people find common lisp a good starter lisp.
If I get the chance I may take a deep-dive into the dialects of Scheme such as Guile or Racket because I've heard a lot of good things in regards to those.
